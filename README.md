<p>
  Almost two years ago I started training as a<b>Full Stack Web Developer</b> (training never ends). I am always looking for opportunities for growth and development both personally and professionally. I consider myself a responsible, creative and ambitious developer. I want to continue training myself, facing new situations and new challenges, adding value to any organization. I bet on constant learning and the enrichment proposed by teamwork.
